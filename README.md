Soluna is a simple, web-based productivity app I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s designed to help you stay organized, manage your time, and actually enjoy being productive, all right in your browser with no account or download needed.

I wanted something lightweight that just works. Most productivity tools feel cluttered or try too hard to be “all-in-one,” so I decided to make my own. Soluna is minimal, aesthetic, and efficient, basically the digital version of having your life together (or at least looking like it).

Inside Soluna, you can create to-do lists, track habits, plan your day, and even study smarter with built-in tools like the Pomodoro timer. It saves everything automatically using local storage, so your progress sticks even when you close the tab.

One of my favorite parts is Focus Mode, which hides distractions and turns your screen into a calm little productivity bubble. There’s also a Mood Tracker to log how you’re feeling, a Study Streak counter to keep you motivated, and even a Daily Quote to give your brain a tiny boost before diving into work.

You can also personalize everything, switch between light and dark themes, pick your own accent color, and rearrange your dashboard with widgets like a mini weather forecast or your task summary.

I built Soluna as a personal project to combine organization and mindfulness in one space. Along the way, I learned a ton about DOM manipulation, data storage, and how to make something that feels simple but does a lot behind the scenes. It’s not overloaded with features, just the ones that make being productive a little easier (and a lot prettier).
