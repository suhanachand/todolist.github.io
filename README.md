# soluna
hi guys welcome back to my creations!!

The main reason I created this app was that many websites and apps, and I mean a lot, require you to pay for a subscription to access basic features like to-do lists or pages where you can type. As someone who doesn't like spending money unnecessarily, I invested my time in creating a similar app to meet all your needs for free. I created this app using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, and surprisingly, the biggest challenge I came across was implementing the toggle features (I know, pretty silly). Still, as you can see, the top left moon changes the app from a white background to a black background, making it easier for users to customize it to their preferences. I hope everyone can use this for their best interest, as being productive and using your life how you want should not be charged and capitalized to such an extreme. Thus, I present you SOLUNA.

P.S. The name is indirectly inspired by my own name, Suhana, but since my last name means 'moon, I have stuck to that theme.
